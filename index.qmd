For my Final Project, I decided to find the atomic mass of caffeine and the formal charges of it's individual atoms. 

Finding the atomic mass of a molecule is easy! Because you're only adding the atomic masses of different atoms the molecule is composed of. 

The formal charge of an atom is known as (the # of valence electrons) - (the # of lone pairs of electrons) - (# of bonds / 2) 

```{python}

# df: Caffeine = "C8 H10 N4 O2"
#Define this better
```
