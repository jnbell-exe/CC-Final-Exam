For my Final Project, I decided to find the molar mass of caffeine and the formal charges of the individual atoms which it is composed of. Furthermore, I will be employing pandas to create a table to display the atomic masses of the individual atoms in the molecular formula of caffeine. After defining the atomic masses, I will utilize sympy to create the equation for both formal charge and molecular formula. Lastly, I will recruit matplotlib to display a graph of my atomic charges. 

Finding the atomic mass of a molecule is easy! Mainly because you re only adding the atomic masses of different atoms the molecule is composed of. 
 

$\ce{C8H10N4O2}$


As you can clearly see, caffeine has 8 Carbons, 10 Hydrogens, 4 Nitrogens and 2 oxygens. 
In order to display the chemical symbols and subscripts, I used a branch of LaTex called <u>**mchem**</u> 

```
include-in-header:
      text:\usepackage[version=4]{mhchem}
```

In this case, I will be using pandas to show the atomic masses of the Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen atoms found in caffeine


```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("Caffeine Content - Sheet1 (1).csv") 

df

```

In here, I plugged a data sheet link ~~Which I definitely did not create just now for this example~~ to be read by pandas and it procures a chart based on what was present in the sheet data. 


```{python}
import sympy as sy
from sympy import symbols, latex

Carbon = 12.011 * 8

Hydrogen = 1.008 * 10

Nitrogen = 14.007 * 4

Oxygen = 15.999 *2

sy.pprint(Carbon + Hydrogen + Nitrogen + Oxygen)

```

From using subsets of sympy, I calculated the molecular mass 

# Finding formal charge

The formal charge of an atom is known as:

$$
(The # of valence electrons) - (the # of lone pairs of electrons) - (# of bonds / 2)
$$

In order to make use out of this formula, we need the molecular structure for caffeine as well as the number of valence shells of each atom.

Getting this image from overleaf.com, I can find the number of bonds needed for the equations.

|**Element**  |**Formal Charge** |
| ----------|:-------------:|
|Carbon     |(6-2)-0-(4/2) = 2 |
|Hydrogen   |(1)-0-(2/2) = -1|
|Nitrogen   |(7-2)-2-(6/2) = 1 |
|Oxygen     |(8-6)-2-(4/2) = -2 |

For my final portion of the project, I wanted to display the differences in formal charge through graphing. 

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

Elements = ['Carbon', 'Hydrogen', 'Nitrogen', 'Oxygen']
FormalCharge = [2, -1,1, -2]

plt.bar(Elements, FormalCharge)
plt.title('Caffeine Charge')
plt.xlabel('Elements')
plt.ylabel('FormalCharge')
plt.show()

```
In conclusion, you can see that Carbon has the largest formal charge while oxygen has the lowest. 

This graph was made possible with matplotlib!

The ==plt== command made it possible for different features of matplotlib to be edited, and could only be displayed by the command ==plt.show==

By using matplotlib for graphing data, LaTex for formatting equations, and Pandas for turning data into a table chart, I can use python to explain complex topics such as molecular structure and formal charge.

Working on this final has been an experience,

- I learned the nuances of packages (mhchem program within LaTex) 

- How to create a website on github

- Editing images and website formatting

Goodnight.
