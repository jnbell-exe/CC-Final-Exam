For my Final Project, I decided to find the atomic mass of caffeine and the formal charges of it's individual atoms. 

Finding the atomic mass of a molecule is easy! Mainly because you're only adding the atomic masses of different atoms the molecule is composed of. 

# Here I'll be calculating atomic mass

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# df =  

# df.columns = ['Atom','Atomic Mass']

```

# Here I'll be finding formal charge

The formal charge of an atom is known as (the # of valence electrons) - (the # of lone pairs of electrons) - (# of bonds / 2)
